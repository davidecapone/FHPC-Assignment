    run_ordered():  performs the ordered evolution of the playground
        and saves the result to a file.
        Ordered evolution means that the evolution of the playground
        is computed evaluating the next state of a cell and updating 
        it before moving to the next cell.
        note: the ordered evolution can be performed only in serial
        for the point of view of MPI.

    fname:  name of the file containing the initial state of the playground
    k:      size of the squre matrix that's going to rapresent
            the playground
    n:      number of generations must be computed
    s:      every how many generations save a snapshot
    rank:   rank of the process
    size:   number of processes
