# Foundations of High Performance Computing - Assignment

This repository contains the two assignments for the course "**Foundations of High Performance Computing**" of the University of Trieste (Data Science & Scientific Computing, a.a. 2022/2023).

- [assignment_1](assignment_1): a parallel implementation of the Conway's Game of Life using the C programming language, with a hybridization of the MPI and OpenMP libraries, following the requirements given in the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Foundations_of_HPC_2022/blob/main/Assignment/exercise1/Assignment_exercise1.pdf) file, follows a scalability test on the Orfeo cluster;
  
- [assignment_2](assignment_2): an evaluation of two math libraries (openBLAS and MKL), through the execution of a level 3 BLAS routine to perform some scalability tests (<i>dgemm</i>) on the Orfeo cluster, as specified in the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Foundations_of_HPC_2022/blob/main/Assignment/README.MD).
