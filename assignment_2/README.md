# Assignment 2

An evaluation of two math libraries (openBLAS and MKL), through the execution of a level 3 BLAS routine to perform some scalability tests (<i>dgemm</i>) on the Orfeo cluster, as specified in the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Foundations_of_HPC_2022/blob/main/Assignment/README.MD). 


## Content of this directory

- `Makefile`: it is used to compile the code. Multiple executables are generated by the compiler, since the code has to be runned for different tests, with different libraries and floating point precisions;
- [`gemm_cs.c`](gemm_cs.c): the code that performs the level three BLAS routine, with an ad hoc output for the <b>core scalability</b> tests;
- [`gemm_ss.c`](gemm_ss.c): the code that performs the level three BLAS routine, with an ad hoc output for the <b>size scalability</b> tests;
- [`plots.ipynb`](plots.ipynb): the python code used to create the plots for the final report and analyze them;
- [`assets/`](/assignment_2/assets/): the folder that contains all the graph images for the final report;
- [`results/`](/assignment_2/results/): the folder that contains all the results for the core scaling and for the size scalability analyses;
- [`scripts/`](/assignment_2/scripts/): the folder that contains the slurm scripts for the various tests;
  - [`run_core_scaling_epyc.sh`](/assignment_2/scripts/run_core_scaling_epyc.sh)
  - [`run_core_scaling_thin.sh`](/assignment_2/scripts/run_core_scaling_thin.sh)
  - [`run_size_scaling_epyc.sh`](/assignment_2/scripts/run_size_scaling_epyc.sh)
